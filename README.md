# Overview

This repository is an archive for numerical simulations of 2D diffusion. \\
It includes:
- A monte carlo simulation using random walkers.
- A finite difference simulation.

The apps/main.cpp is the front-end of the program.

The goal isn't necessarily to learn about diffusion, but to apply software design principles towards simulations and to gain a better understanding of how to write numerical simulations.

# Todo
[ ] - Implement recording of data for plotting.
[ ] - Compile with pedantic and all warnings as errors, and fix them all.
